HTML - Review
	- Hypertext mark-up language
		- not a programming language
	- Defines the structure of a webpage using elements represented with HTML tags
		- these tags follow a hierarchal/ nested structure
		- elements can have attributes, name="value", these are used to provide more information to these elements
			- global attributes (for all html elements) - class, id, style...
			- local attributes (element specific) - href, src
	- Inline vs Block elements
		- inline: can be put next to another (span)
		- block: take up the the whole width of the container (div)
	- Semantic elements
		- provide more meanings to tags
			- helps with accessibility
		- Section, Footer, Header, Nav... instead of having a bunch of divs
	- Forms:
		- tag that can be used to submit information
		- <form>
			<label> </label>
			<input/>
				- has attribute type="" to define what kind of input to be passed in
				- has attribute name="" to refer to the information to be processed
	- self closing tags, close themselves. <img src="../myimage.png"/>

CSS
	- cascading style sheets
	- adds looks/style to HTML
	- HTML is the structure of the document, CSS is the styling
	- consists 
		- selector {
			property: value;
		}
	- CSS can be included in 3 different ways
		- inline
			- in the HTML tag directly
			- <div style="property:value"></div>
		- internally
			- in the HTML document, head 
			- <style> 
				selector {
					property: value;
				}
			  </style>
		- externally
			- from an external stylesheet, best practive because can reuse it
			- <link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css"/>
	- Selectors
		- used to target specific elements to apply style to
			- tag
			- class (.className)
			- id (#idName) - "supposed" to be unique to an element, but not enforced
			- more depending on the need(find more in one of the resources)
		- the order in which styles are applied is based on specificity
		- most to least: id > class > tag
